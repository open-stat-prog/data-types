```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
f1 <- factor(sample(1:3, 10, TRUE), levels = 1:3, labels = 3:1)
```

Question
========

Consider the factor `f1` generated by the following code.

```
v1 <- sample(1:3, 10, TRUE)
f1 <- factor(v1, levels = 1:3, labels = 3:1)
```


What will the expression `levels(f1)` return?

Answerlist
----------
* The character vector: `"3", "2", "1"`
* The character vector: `"1", "2", "3"`
* The numeric vector: `3, 2, 1`
* The numeric vector: `1, 2, 3`
* The numeric vector: `3`
* A length-10 numeric vector containing some combination of the values: `1, 2, 3`.
* A length-10 character vector containing some combination of the values: `"1", "2", "3"`.
* A length-10 factor containing some combination of the values: `1, 2, 3`.

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* Correct
* Wrong: This vector is ordered incorrectly.
* Wrong: Factor level names are always character values.
* Wrong: Factor level names are always character values (these numbers are also ordered incorrectly).
* Wrong: This is the number of levels, `nlevels(f1)`.
* Wrong: `f1` has ten elements, but it has only three levels.
* Wrong: `f1` has ten elements, but it has only three levels.
* Wrong: `f1` has ten elements, but it has only three levels.
