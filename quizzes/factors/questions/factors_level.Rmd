```{r prep, echo = FALSE}

fac <- factor(sample(1:3, 20, TRUE), labels = c("Yes","No","Maybe"))

```

Question
========

Consider the factors in `fac` below, how can we store the levels in the new vector `lev`?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fac
```


Solution
========
We extract the names of the levels using the function `levels()`

Meta-information
================
exname: DF Row
extype: string
exsolution: lev <- levels(fac)
