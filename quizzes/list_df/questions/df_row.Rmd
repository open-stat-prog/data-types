```{r prep, echo = FALSE}

df <- data.frame(names = c("bob", "mike", "mark", "steve"),
          age = c(25,23,24,26),
          height = c(180,178,169,183),
          eyes = c("green","green","blue","black")
                 )

```

Question
========

Consider the data frame `df` below, how can we extract only the data about Bob?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df

```


Solution

We have to select the first row of the data frame, and we can do this using `df[1,]`
