```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", cache = FALSE}
library(exams)

## Generate some data
a <- sample(1:5, 3)
b <- sample(1:5, 3)

solution <- paste(a * b, collapse = ", ")
```

Question
========
What is the value of `a * b`, given the following vectors? 

$$
\begin{align*}
a &= `r a`\\
b &= `r b`
\end{align*}
$$

- Format you answer as `element1, element2, element3, ...`
- Separate each element with a comma and a space.
- Misformatted answer won't be recognized as correct

Solution
========
The `a * b` implements element-wise multiplication, so the result is `r solution`.

Meta-information
