Lists are one of R's most versatile and ubiquitous data structures. Like vectors, lists are one-dimensional objects.
Unlike vectors, however, lists can comprise arbitrary mixes of data objects with any combination of types. This
flexibility makes lists particularly useful for storing and organizing heterogeneous data such as the results returned
from statistical modeling functions.
