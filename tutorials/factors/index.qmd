title: "Factors"
---

In statistical data analysis, we often necessary to represent categorical variables: data that fall into of discrete
groups or levels. Typical examples include nominal variables like {"male", "female"}, {"yes", "no"}, or political party
affiliation. In R, we use *factors* to represent categorical variables in our data.

An R factor is a special kind of object that encodes a categorical variable's grouping information through in a
consistent way that R functions know how to handle. Factors are particularly important for modeling and plotting
functions. When we use a categorical variable as part of a statistical model or visualization, the variable needs
special treatment to be treated as groupings or levels, rather than as continuous quantities.
