## Accessing and Modifying Matrix Elements

We can access and assign values within a matrix using square brackets, just like with vectors—but with one key difference: matrices require two indices, one for the row and one for the column.

```{r}
(m1 <- matrix(1:9,3,3))
m1[1:2, 1:3]
```

This grabs the top two rows and all three columns. If we want specific entries, we can use more targeted indexing:

```{r}
(m2 <- m1[c(1, 3), 2])
```

This selects the second column from rows 1 and 3.

Assignment works the same way—we simply specify a position and assign a new value:

```{r}
(m3 <- matrix(1,3,3))
m3[1, 2] <- 33
m3[2:3, c(1, 3)] <- 44
m3
```
