In R, matrices are a fundamental data structure used to represent two-dimensional collections of values. Just like vectors, all elements in a matrix must be of the same type—numeric, character, logical, or otherwise. You can think of a matrix as an extension of a vector, where data is organized into rows and columns.

At their core, matrices are essentially vectors with a dimension attribute that tells R to interpret them in a grid-like structure. So, while they look like tables, they’re still built on the foundation of vectors.

Whenever you're working with tabular numeric data, performing linear algebra operations, or doing more advanced data analysis, you're likely using matrices—whether explicitly or behind the scenes.
