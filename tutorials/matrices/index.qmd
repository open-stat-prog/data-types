title: "Matrices"

In R, matrices are a fundamental data structure used to represent two-dimensional collections of homogenously typed
values. Just like vectors, all elements in a matrix must have the same type: one of the [six atomic
modes](/tutorials/vectors/atomic_modes.qmd). You can think of R matrices as generalizations of R vectors. Matrices are
just vectors with a dimension attribute that tells R to interpret matrices as two-dimensional objects with rows and
columns.
