By completing these tutorials, you've built a solid foundation in understanding five of the most ubiquitous and useful
data types in R:

- Vectors
- Matrices
- Lists
- Data frames
- Factors

## Next Steps 

With this knowledge in place, you're ready to shift focus from what R works with to how you work in R. In the next
module, we’ll explore workflows—covering scripts, working directories, R projects, paths, and coding style—to help you
build reproducible, organized, and efficient R projects from the ground up.
