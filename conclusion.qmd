## Next Steps 

Now that you have a good introduction to the fundamental elements of the R statistical programming language, you're
ready to start thinking about how to best organize your data analysis projects. In the next module, we’ll explore
different aspects of effective R workflows--—scripts, working directories, R projects, file paths, and coding style—--to
help you create reproducible, organized, and efficient data analysis projects.
